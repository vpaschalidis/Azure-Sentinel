name: Potential Exploitation of MS-RPRN printer bug
description: |
  'This query detects potential attempts to remotely access to the print spooler service on Active Directory Domain Controllers which could indicate an exploitation of MS-RPRN printer bug from a server that is configured with unconstrained delegation.
   This query searches for the event id 5145 on Domain Controllers where the ShareName is "\\\*\IPC$" and the RelativeTargetName is "spoolss".'
